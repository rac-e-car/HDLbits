/*In this question, you will design a circuit for an 8x1 memory, 
where writing to the memory is accomplished by shifting-in bits, and reading is "random access", 
as in a typical RAM. You will then use the circuit to realize a 3-input logic function.

First, create an 8-bit shift register with 8 D-type flip-flops. 
Label the flip-flop outputs from Q[0]...Q[7]. The shift register input should be called S, 
which feeds the input of Q[0] (MSB is shifted in first). The enable input controls whether to shift. 
Then, extend the circuit to have 3 additional inputs A,B,C and an output Z. 
The circuit's behaviour should be as follows: when ABC is 000, Z=Q[0], when ABC is 001, Z=Q[1], and so on. 
Your circuit should contain ONLY the 8-bit shift register, and multiplexers. 
(Aside: this circuit is called a 3-input look-up-table (LUT)).*/
