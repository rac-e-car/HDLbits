/* Given four unsigned numbers, find the minimum. 
Unsigned numbers can be compared with standard comparison operators (a < b). 
Use the conditional operator to make two-way min circuits, then compose a few of them to create a 4-way min circuit. 
You'll probably want some wire vectors for the intermediate results. */
